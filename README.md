# Quarter_Car


(WIP - note not all is implemented yet)
Quarter_Car is a quarter-car simulation based on a state space model with road velocity as input. It models a quarter car with a sprung and unsprung mass. The quarter car has both an unsprung and sprung spring, and a sprung and unsprung damper. Where the springs can have either a linear or bilinear spring rate. Additionally, the dampers can be either linear or 4-way adjustable with high/low-speed compression and rebound. Three road inputs are available, impulse road input, sinusoidal road input and random road input.
